\section{Introduction}
In this paper i will be discussing five topics that i have learned about this year that i found interesting. These topics could include Unix commands, unix tools, and features of perl. The topics i will be discussing are: <STDIN> within Perl, How similar Perl is to C, The kind of things that perl can be used for, Sort operator in perl, Hashes in perl. 
\label{sec:examples}

\subsection{STDIN}

Using <STDIN> in perl is a very easy way of getting standard input in perl. And i found it very interesting that there was no need of any libraries really in order to use standard input even though in c++ you have to include<fstream>, make a variable and then use the variable in order to be able to input data from the stream. The fact that it's so simple to be able to input is just the start of some of the thins that are made simple in Perl that help make it easy to program in it.

\subsection{Similarites of Perl to C}

It was an easy transition from C++ to Perl. Since C++ is similar to C and Perl has very many similarities to C. Not only does it have similar syntax but the things that you can do in the two languages in terms of the logic is pretty similar. For example you have control structures in both languages, you have relational expressions in both languages and many more things that are similar in both languages.

\subsection{Use of Perl}

The use of Perl was something that i personally questioned when i first started using it and was trying to figure out what it's used for. 



\subsection{Mathematics}

\LaTeX{} is great at typesetting mathematics. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
$$S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
      = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i$$
denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.

\subsection{Lists}

You can make lists with automatic numbering \dots

\begin{enumerate}
\item Like this,
\item and like this.
\end{enumerate}
\dots or bullet points \dots
\begin{itemize}
\item Like this,
\item and like this.
\end{itemize}

We hope you find write\LaTeX\ useful, and please let us know if you have any feedback using the help menu above.
